h1. js_tutorial - The Inline Tutorial Framework (Powered by JQuery & Javascript)

Easily install a Javascript tutorial on any page, which allows you to provide a series 
of breadcrumbs to the user to teach them how to do something on a webpage.

Tested to run on JQuery 1.3.2, although other versions may work.

@js_tutorial@ is designed so that you can provide a custom tutorial story file that 
describes a series of breadcrumbs, and @js_tutorial@ will display them to the user,
in the correct order.
